# Experimental LuaRocks Build Backend for LuaLS Addons

## Supported environment variables

> [!NOTE]
> The path separator used in these examples is `;`, but may change based on `package.config`, a.k.a. the operating system. If path-list variables are included in a rockspec, split the declarations by platform.

- `LLSADDON_LUARCPATH="$path1;$path2;..."`: a list of paths indicating which `.luarc.json`-style files to modify when installing the addon.
- `LLSADDON_VSCSETTINGSPATH="$path1;$path2;..."`: a list of paths indicating which `.vscode/settings.json`-style files to modify when installing the addon.
   - If at least one of the above variables is set to `""` and the other is unset, no config files will be modified by the build process.

## Building

1. Start by cloning this repo.

2. `luarocks --local --lua-version=5.4 make` to build this rock and install it in the user-level rocks tree so it can be used to build other rocks.

3. For testing, clone an addon. I have been using the [cc-tweaked documentation addon](https://gitlab.com/carsakiller/cc-tweaked-documentation).

4. Within that cloned addon, create a `.rockspec`, like below:

`cc-tweaked-dev-1.rockspec`

```lua
rockspec_format = "3.0"
package = "cc-tweaked"
version = "dev-1"
source = {
	url = "https://gitlab.com/carsakiller/cc-tweaked-documentation",
}
description = {
	summary = "LuaCATS annotations for CC:Tweaked",
	detailed = "Manually created LuaCATS annotations for Minecraft's CC:Tweaked computer mod",
	homepage = "https://gitlab.com/carsakiller/cc-tweaked-documentation",
	license = "MIT",
}
build = {
	type = "lls-addon",
	settings = {
      runtime = {
         version = "Lua 5.3",
         builtin = {
            io = "disable",
            os = "disable",
         },
      },
	},
}
```

5. Try to install the repo by running `luarocks make`. This will use the custom build backend to copy some directories/files and modify/create the `.luarc.json` file to make LuaLS aware.

6. You should see that there is a `.luarc.json` in the `cc-tweaked`'s project directory with all the required keys filled in.

Now you should have types! This step obviously still needs a lot of work to automatically apply the path and deal with global/local installs, etc.

You can try adding plugins or other settings to see if everything is working as intended.

## Testing

1. Set the contents of `.luarocks/default-lua-version.lua` to `return 5.4`. The build fails otherwise, I don't know why.
2. Run `luarocks test`.

---

It isn't ideal, but it is using nothing but LuaRocks ðŸ¤·. I would love a `dev_dependencies` field in `.rockspec` files to allow the addon to be installed for dev work but not build/prod. Open to any suggestions on how to improve this, including not hacking around LuaRocks and just creating a separate CLI tool ðŸ˜„
